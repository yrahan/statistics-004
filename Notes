Week 2:

P(A or B) = P(A) + P(B) - P(A and B)

A, B independent  <=> P(A|B)  = P(A)
A, B disjoint     <=> P(A and B) = 0

Bayes' Theorem:
P(A | B) = P(A anb B) / P(B)

Binomial distribution
mean  = np
sd    = sqrt(np * (1 - p))
Sucess-failure rule :
np >= 10 and n(1-p) >= 10  => normal approximation okay for a binomial distribution
